Here's a list of features we need to implement in the coming weeks:

simple(?) stuff:
- handle socket disconnection without fatal error in Go (assign player death instead)
- game over screen, list player finishing order to screen (easy)

harder stuff:
- implement grace period of missed moves before killing player (do we want to do this?)
- implement leader hierarchy with super leaders etc.
- handle leader failure (introduce leader leases or something)
- nail down evaluation method (how good is our thing?)

nice to have:
- better GUI?
- music?
